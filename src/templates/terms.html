<h1>Terms of Service</h1>
<p>Last updated: December 8, 2025</p>
<p>These Terms of Service (&quot;Terms&quot;) govern your access to and use of the CLIST website, tools and API (collectively, the &quot;Service&quot;). By using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms.</p>

<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>The Service is provided by CLIST (&quot;we&quot;, &quot;us&quot;, &quot;our&quot;). The Service includes the public website, user accounts, and any public or authenticated API endpoints we provide.</p>
<p>By accessing or using the Service, you confirm that you have read, understood and agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, you must not use the Service.</p>

<h1>Use of the Service</h1>
<p>You agree to use the Service in good faith and to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>comply with applicable laws and regulations;</li>
  <li>not attempt to disrupt, attack, overload or reverse-engineer the Service;</li>
  <li>not attempt to bypass any technical or access limitations we put in place;</li>
  <li>not use the Service for abusive, fraudulent or malicious activities.</li>
</ul>
<p>We reserve the right to temporarily or permanently restrict access to the Service or to your account if we detect abuse, security issues or violations of these Terms.</p>

<h1>Accounts</h1>
<p>Some parts of the Service may require a user account.</p>
<ul>
  <li>You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials.</li>
  <li>You are responsible for all activities that occur under your account.</li>
  <li>You must promptly notify us of any unauthorized use of your account or other security breach you become aware of.</li>
</ul>
<p>We may suspend or terminate accounts that are used in violation of these Terms or to circumvent technical limits.</p>

<h1>API Usage</h1>
<p>CLIST may provide a free API intended mainly for personal, educational and community projects.</p>
<p>When using the API, you agree to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>respect any documented or communicated rate limits;</li>
  <li>implement reasonable caching to avoid repeated requests for the same data within a short time;</li>
  <li>keep your API credentials secret and not publish them in public repositories;</li>
  <li>clearly attribute CLIST as the source of contest data when used in public projects.</li>
</ul>
<p>You agree <strong>not</strong> to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>resell, repackage or redistribute CLIST’s raw data as a competing contest API or commercial data feed without a separate agreement with us;</li>
  <li>use automated requests in a way that harms the stability or performance of the Service;</li>
  <li>misrepresent your project as an official CLIST product or service without our explicit consent.</li>
</ul>
<p>We may change rate limits, API endpoints or access policies at any time, and we may revoke API access in case of abuse or violation of these Terms.</p>

<h1>Attribution</h1>
<p>Attribution is appreciated whenever you use CLIST data in a public website, application, extension or other project.</p>
<p>A suggested format is:</p>
<blockquote>
  Contest data provided by <a href="https://clist.by/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">CLIST</a>
</blockquote>
<p>or</p>
<blockquote>
  Powered by <a href="https://clist.by/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">CLIST</a>
</blockquote>
<p>If you use our name or logo, you should not present your project as an &quot;official&quot; CLIST product unless we have explicitly agreed to that.</p>

<h1>&quot;As is&quot; Disclaimer</h1>
<p>The Service is provided on an &quot;as is&quot; and &quot;as available&quot; basis.</p>
<p>We do not make any guarantees regarding, for example:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the accuracy, completeness or freshness of contest data;</li>
  <li>uninterrupted availability of the website or API;</li>
  <li>freedom from errors, bugs or security vulnerabilities.</li>
</ul>
<p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, CLIST shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special or consequential damages arising from your use of, or inability to use, the Service, including (but not limited to) missed contests, loss of data, loss of opportunities or any other losses.</p>

<h1>Changes to the Service and Terms</h1>
<p>We may modify or discontinue parts of the Service at any time, with or without notice.</p>
<p>We may also update these Terms from time to time. When we do so, we will update the &quot;Last updated&quot; date at the top of this page. Your continued use of the Service after any changes to these Terms means you accept the updated Terms.</p>

<h1>Contact</h1>
